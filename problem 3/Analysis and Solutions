TypeScript Typing Usage: 
    While TypeScript is used, the typing could be more explicit and leveraged better. For instance, the getPriority function accepts a parameter blockchain of type any, which undermines TypeScript's type checking capabilities.

Unnecessary Recalculation: 
    The getPriority function is called repetitively for each element in the balances array, leading to unnecessary computation when elements share the same blockchain.

Using Index as Key: 
    the array index as the key for list items (<li key={index}>) can lead to performance issues, especially when the order of items changes. React may re-render all items in the list instead of only those that have changed.

Redundant Formatting: 
    The formattedBalances array is created by mapping over sortedBalances to format each balance, but this formatting could be combined with the initial mapping to avoid redundant computations.

To improve the code:

Optimize getPriority Function: 
    Instead of repeatedly calling getPriority for each element, you could precompute a mapping of blockchain types to their respective priorities. This would eliminate redundant calculations.

Use a Stable Key for List Items: 
    If possible, use a unique and stable identifier for each item in the sortedBalances array instead of the array index. This helps React optimize re-renders by identifying which items have changed.

Avoid Unnecessary Formatting: 
    Instead of creating a separate array (formattedBalances) for formatted balances, you can format the balances directly within the map function used to generate the rows array.
